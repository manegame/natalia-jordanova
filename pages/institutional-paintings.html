<p class="description" data-counter="7">The installation in the exhibition can be seen as an enclosed space dealing with human-animal relations. It consists of multiple elements. None of them refers to a particular location. The organic is presented by the natural rubber and a piece of grass and soil. Further, it’s suggested by the shapes that processed materials define. Naturally the visual properties are changing–slow enough, not to be noticed. Like skin, it is essential, as carrier and cover. Steel and copper designate the excess and accessibility of the raw material. Figuration is reduced to physical anatomical structures and the human is present through the trace of activity.</p>
